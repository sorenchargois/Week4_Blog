### Trace 7014, by Etsuko Icheikawa

This piece is a glass pyrograph by Japanese artist Etsuko Icheikawa called Trace 2014. Etsuko essientially uses fire and water, in pyrographs and aquagraphs respectively, to “capture and eternalize the immdiacy of a moment."

I think this is such a striking image due largely to the feeling it evokes in me. I think of Tumblr girls and smoke and long nights of reckless carelessness. I want the burn to keep going, moving and evolving and growing lighter and lighter as it dissipates into the air. But I have to be content with the fact that it never will. And I think there’s beauty in that also.

### J013 One-of-a-Kind 13ba, by Kim Keever

I **love** this. Like, I would put it in my son’s bedroom. More than the image itself, I love the creative process by which it was made. American artist Kim Keever, based in NYC, captures seemingly vast and timeless images for a combination of artifice and naturalism. 

According to his Artsy page, Keever’s landscapes are actually detailed miniature scenes that he builds himself, places in a 200-gallon tank, submerges in water, and photographs. I think this is one of the more striking artistic processes I’ve ever witnesses, with some of what I consider the most beautiful results.
